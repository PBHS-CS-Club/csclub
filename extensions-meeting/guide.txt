How to create an extention:

1. Make a manifest file
  - make a file in a folder called "manifest.json". this is where you write the name and version of the extension
  - type curly brace "{}" and write the rest of list inside
  - inside the "{}", make 3 tags with this format:
  
      "manifest_version": "3",
    
    this is like adding elements to an array, except every element has a value assigned to it
    in this case, manifest_version has a value of 3
    do this for "verison" and "name" aswell (you can set their values to whatever you want)

2. Make a Javascript file
  - make a new js file in the same folder
  - inside, write a function that loops through ever element of the page and sets the background color to black

3. Link the JS file to manifest.json
  - inside of manifest.json, add in a new tag that looks like this:
  
      "content_scripts": [
        {
          "js": ["[YOUR FILE NAME HERE.js"],
          "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
        }
      ]
  
    this will link the js file to the extension through the "js" property
    the "matches" property specifies on what pages the extension will run. "<all_urls>" makes it run on every website ever
  - now the extension is finished!

4. Load the extension into a browser
  - open a browser and go to its settings
  - find extension settings
  - somewhere on the page (top right for Chrome) turn on Developer Mode
  - now, you should see a button called "Load Unpacked". click on it and then click on your folder that has the JavaScript and manifest.json files.
  - the extension should now be active!
